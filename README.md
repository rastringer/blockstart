## Block Start
A proof of  concept for a blockchain-based crowdfunding site. With great thanks to Stephen Grider's excellent Udemy course on Ethereum and Solidity.

### The problem
Crowd funding sites have proven excellent methods of getting projects off the ground. One flaw of their design is that once a user contributes to a particular campaign, the creator of that campaign has no responsibility to eventually show how the money was used, or even complete the tasks mentioned in the proposal. 

### How blockchain can help

This ethereum-based project encourages a new transparency and accountability in crowdfunding platforms. A campaign manager can propose the minimum contribution required for a user to become an 'approver' on that project. Once the funds are contributed, the campaign manager has to win consensus of all 'approvers' before spending the committed funds on a particular part of the project.

### Technologies 

Ethereum: Solidity and Web3. 

Front-end: Next.js, React.js and some Semantic-Ui-React components for style.

Users will require a Metamask account. This project is still in development and currently tested on the Rinkeby test network.
